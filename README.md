# Class12ComputerProject
(My First Repo) This repo contains the simple code of my class 12th computer project on Railway Management and Reservation service.


Modules I used in this project are:
mysql.connentor (a mysql and python connenctor)
AND my own python file imported as module (rrms.py)
=> code through which i access rrms.py 
=> import rrms 

NOTE: main.py only works when rrms.py is present in your device.
